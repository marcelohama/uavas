AgentSpeak for UAV Development. UAVAS is a framework that employs Agent-Oriented programming techniques to develop UAV behaviors. This project uses a communication protocol model to enable high-level interactions, such as team-work cooperations or path travels. In the images, there are the screenshot of a simulation with teams, the UAVAS framework's conceptual, and a screenshot of a simulation with Flight Model Simulator RC-Sim. Some objectives of this project are:
<ul>
  <li>Create a simulator engine to test our AgentSpeak codes (working with <a href="http://jbullet.advel.cz/" target="blank">JBullet</a> to implement the 3D physic environment);</li>
  <li>Develop a custom framework to operate under <a href="http://www.mikrokopter.de/ucwiki/en/MikroKopter" target="blank">MikroKopter</a> UAV's (currently, implementing with <a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/" target="blank">DSL</a>);</li>
  <li>Research the area of multi-agent languages applied to UAVs, with development and simulation of algorithms (working with <a href="http://jason.sourceforge.net/Jason/Jason.html" target="blank">Jason</a> to implement the agents);</li>
</ul>
